# LIVE Front End Developer Test
A sample solution to the LIVE Competition front-end developer test.

## Instructions
All the instructions to the front-end developer test are located in this [PDF document](instructions.pdf).

## The Solution
The sample solution clearly does not include nicely written JavaScript that is easy to read. This was not the point of the test, and it will be ignored as such. This test was just to clearly understand each developer's ability to understand Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and best practices in such a short amount of time.

## Credits
Author of instructions and sample solution is Alvin Tang, Vice-president of Information Technology at LIVE Competition.
